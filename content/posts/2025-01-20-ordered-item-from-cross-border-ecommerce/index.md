I registered on the site, and they didn’t ask for any personal information such as my first or last name. The only requirement was a phone number. After confirming my number, I created a 4-digit PIN to log in. That was it—just a phone number and a 4-digit PIN to register!

Next, they asked me to choose one of their branch addresses for picking up orders. Before ordering the main item—which costs $90–$100 (ill buy later CPU if this site is trust-able)—I decided to test the service first. I ordered **DDR3 8GB x 2 1600 MHz** RAM for a total of $9 (a cheap option).

Here’s the price breakdown:

| Product                            | Qty | Price              | Total                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| DDR3 8GB 1600 MHz                  | 2   | $4.50 / 17,500 MNT | $9.00 / 31,400 MNT      |
| Internal shipping cost in China    | 1   | $2.50 / 9,000 MNT  | $2.50 / 9,000 MNT       |
| Internal shipping cost in Mongolia | 1   | $1.14 / 4,000 MNT  | $1.14 / 4,000 MNT       |
|                                    |     |                    | **$12.64 / 44,400 MNT** | 

After checkout, they generated a QR code for **QPay** (local e-payment or e-wallet system). The payment was successful, but when I checked the transaction, QPay merchant account was an individual’s name, not **Hibox LLC** or any registered company’s bank account.
